In practice, the interpretation of meaning is frequently clarified by the use of an associative noun, e.g., autoinjector system or helicopter system.</span></p><p><img src="./../Images/image-20230922220236920.png" alt="image-20230922220236920" style="zoom: 50%;" /></p><p><span>A technical system is a combination of interacting elements organized to satisfy one or more system requirements. Thus, a technical system has a purpose. It is created and utilised to provide services, in a defined operating environment (or context), for the benefit of users and other stakeholders.  A system is comprised of multiple systems usually referred as subsystems or system elements. Subsystems have relationships between each other and can be of different nature: people, hardware, software, facilities, policies, processes and documents. The order and arrangement of the subsystems affect the system performances. Finally, a system has a boundary that separates it from external systems and stakeholders (see illustration above).</span></p><p><img src="./../Images/image-20230922221313015.png" alt="image-20230922221313015" style="zoom:50%;" /></p><p><span>Technical systems are becoming more and more complex. We moved from the era of craftsman who used creativity to offer highly customised - not to say unique - products to their customers to standardized industrial systems based on repeatable processes. After the era of greatest inventions, which aimed at solving technical problems, we observe that complex technical systems have been invented based on the combination of greatest inventions. For instance, the transportation system is a network of cars, the communication system is a network of telephones, and so on. More recently, complex systems have been integrated to give birth to socio-technical systems of systems by merging. For instance the electrical cars network is a system of systems that integrates the transportation system and the energy system. The growing systemic complexity can be summarised by four dimensions:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>The technical complexity (growing number of parts and interfaces, multi-physical phenomenon, emergent properties, etc.)</span></p></li><li><p><span>The diversity (product lines which require to manage several variants and options)</span></p></li><li><p><span>The organisational complexity (extended enterprise, multi-site, multi-national, etc.)</span></p></li><li><p><span>The prescriptive texts (laws, standards, internal and external policies, guidelines, etc.)</span></p></li></ul><p><span>Among the numerous characteristics of complex systems, emergent properties is maybe what best characterise the systemic complexity. An emergent property is a new property which is found at higher levels of a system as a result of interactions at a lower level. Traffic is a familiar example of emergent properties — it’s a property of a collection of cars but not of an individual car. In the realm of physics, things like temperature and pressure are emergent; an individual molecule doesn’t have a temperature or pressure, which are properties of collections of molecules like gases or liquids. Causation does not only point from lower to higher systemic levels; the properties emerging from collective behaviour can also constrain the behaviour of the individual entities. Again, traffic serves as an excellent example: while traffic emerges from the interaction of many individual cars, it also affects their behaviour, limiting and guiding them. </span></p><p><img src="./../Images/image-20230922210754275.png" alt="image-20230922210754275" style="zoom:67%;" /><a href='https://www.nature.com/scitable/blog/accumulating-glitches/selfish_genes_emergent_properties/'><span>Source</span></a></p><h2 id='the-nature-of-systems-engineering-is-it-an-approach-process--method'><span>The nature of systems engineering: is it an approach, process, [...], method?</span></h2><p><span>Whether it is in industry or academic research, Systems Engineering (SE) is defined as an approach, a process or a method for engineering technical systems.</span></p><p><span>A process is a set of activities that tells you &quot;What&quot; to do, &quot;When&quot; to deliver it, and &quot;Who&quot; is responsible for it.

You will not find any method that covers all activities of your design process but someone will have to work-out methodological elements to reliably perform them. There is no clear boundary between sub-processes and methods. For instance, in the 6-activity (Emphasize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test, Assess) Design Thinking process illustrated below, the bullet points are sub-activities that tells you « How » to perform the main activities. In this course, we will consider the set of sub-activities (e.g., Conduct interviews, Uncover emotions, Seek stories) as a sub-process and not a method as there is no clear procedure to perform the activity Empathize.</span></p><p><img src="./../Images/image-20230911125637692.png" alt="image-20230911125637692" style="zoom: 50%;" /></p><p><span>However, the Design Thinking Toolbox offers a clear definition of the Design Thinking process and method.

In addition to the process, the Design Thinking Toolbox proposes a set of methods to support the practitioners. For instance, to perform the activity Understand, one must follow the problem statement method, design principles method, [...], emotional response cards method.</span></p><p><img src="./../Images/image-20230911130909232.png" alt="image-20230911130909232" style="zoom:80%;" /></p><p><span>Each method contains detailed instructions (materials, procedure, template, etc.).

Each company has its own set of processes and methods for implementing Systems Engineering. Consequently, Systems Engineering is a design approach. In this course, a design approach is a logical way of thinking that relies upon several elements - convictions, processes, methods, tools... - establishing a design discipline among New Product Development (NPD) team members. Systems Engineering is a methodical and interdisciplinary design approach that mainly concentrates on four main activities: requirements definition, requirements validation and architecture design performed recursively in a top-down process, plus integration and verification of design and implementation performed recursively in a bottom-up process. </span></p><blockquote><p><em><strong><u><span>Systems engineering</span></u></strong><span> is a </span><strong><span>methodical</span></strong><span>, disciplined </span><strong><span>approach</span></strong><span> for the design, realization, technical management, operations, and retirement of a system.

Indeed, the reputation of the organisation (company or research lab) in which the approach has been pioneered serves as a proxy for justifying the choice of one design approach over another. Looking for successful applications in well-known companies published by well-known academics explains how the uptake of a design approach can behave like fashions, where many companies take up a design approach at the same time and then also discard it at the same time. </span></p><h2 id='the-genesis-of-systems-engineering'><span>The genesis of systems engineering</span></h2><p><span>The Systems Engineering body of knowledge started to emerge during the world war II and the cold war with the development of missiles and missile-defense systems by the Department Of Defense of the USA.

Design Thinking is often preferred for developing small-scale projects where there is room for creativity. Conversely, Systems Engineering requires to translate system functions into unambiguous quantitative system requirements an to systematically decompose high level requirements/designs into lower level requirements/design before continuously verifying and validating the integrated design from subsystems to system. Applying Systems Engineering to develop a bedside lamp may be of little interest since the very low level of complexity of the system does not require a decomposition into subsystems to be managed. Developing a new commercial aircraft with a Design Thinking approach starting from fuzzy needs, quick prototyping efforts and end-users testings is also not appropriate for such a complex system. However, both approaches can be mixed. In a Systems Engineering approach, Design Thinking can help to clarify qualitative requirements using formative studies which consist in creating a low-fidelity prototype and performing tests with targeted end-users. Design Thinking is also of interest to generate conceptual solutions to a given set of (system) requirements.</span></p><p><img src="./../Images/image-20230911123351722.png" alt="image-20230911123351722" style="zoom:67%;" /></p><p><span>Alternatives to the Systems Engineering approach include:</span></p><p><img src="./../Images/image-20231007143131796.png" alt="image-20231007143131796" style="zoom: 50%;" /></p><h2 id='systems-engineering-is-an-approach-standardised-by-international-organisations'><span>Systems engineering is an approach standardised by international organisations</span></h2><p><span>Compared to many other design approaches, Systems Engineering is standardised by international standard development organisations (e.g., ISO, IEEE...) and is tailored to industries by more specific recommended practices (e.g., ARP in the aerospace industry, FDA in the food and drug industry...).

Looking at the set of Systems Engineering processes defined in the ISO 15288:2015, you will notice that Systems Engineering is not all about technical processes but also enterprise, project, and agreement processes. Although it is relevant to consider both the the product &quot;</span><em><span>le système à faire</span></em><span>&quot; and the project &quot;</span><em><span>le système pour faire (le système à faire)</span></em><span>&quot;, systems engineering is not about project management.

Greenfield land is previously undeveloped space, such as a (green) farmer’s field. Brownfield land has been previously developed, typically has existing structures and services in place, and may contain undesirable or hazardous materials (also known as waste) that must be remediated.</span></p><p><span>Greenfield systems engineering, also known as “clean sheet” or “blank slate” systems engineering, involves systems that are new designs and have no, or limited, legacy systems constraints, other than system interfaces. Traditionally, systems engineering has been taught by considering systems from a greenfield perspective. One starts with a “clean or blank sheet of paper” and determines the set of stakeholders and their needs, translates them into system requirements and validates them, architects and designs a system solution, implements the system elements, and then continuously integrates and verifies subsystems&#39; design and implementation. While this is an effective way to teach systems engineering and to prepare practitioners with skills applicable to the entire system life cycle, few system development efforts are truly greenfield. Greenfield, therefore, is an almost theoretical situation that is rarely seen in practice. Sometimes, it can be quite traumatic for organizations that make brownfield updates to its legacy products over a long period of time to transition from brownfield development back to greenfield. They may need to “relearn” how to do greenfield.</span></p><p><span>Brownfield systems engineering, also known as “legacy” SE, involves significant modifications, extensions, or replacement of an existing “as-is” system in an existing environment to an updated “to-be” system. Brownfield systems often contain waste (e.g., technical debt) that may need to be remediated. “In-service” systems are another example of brownfield system. Brownfield systems typically have explicit continuity requirements, where the operation of the as-is system needs to continue, resulting in a deliberate transition to the updated system.</span></p><p><img src="./../Images/image-20230923142117791.png" alt="image-20230923142117791" style="zoom:67%;" /></p><p><span>The nature of greenfield and brownfield systems drives different life cycle approaches that reflect different areas of emphasis. The table above lays out some of the key differences across a set of aspects important to systems engineering.

This problem is not confined to any one country or any one company. It exists everywhere. Universities throughout the world have not given their engineering students generalized, codified, and systematic knowledge in design. Instead, design has been treated as a subject that is not amenable to scientific treatment. Consequently, design has depended on intuitive and innate reasoning rather than on rigorous scientific study. This section will introduce some good practices to develop engineered systems and reduce the intuitive trial-and-error approach.</span></p><h3 id='develop-system-requirements'><span>Develop system requirements</span></h3><p><span>Often designers find that the precise description of &quot;what we want to achieve&quot; is a difficult task. Many designers deliberately leave them implicit rather than explicit and then, start working on design solutions even before they have clearly defined their design goals. They measure their success by comparing their design with the implicit design goals they had in mind. They spend a great deal of time to improve and iterate the design until the design solution and &quot;what they had in mind&quot; converge, which is a time consuming process at best. To be efficient and to generate the design that meets the perceived needs, we must specifically state the design goals in terms of &quot;what we want to achieve&quot; and begin the design process. Iterations between &quot;what&quot; and &quot;how&quot; are necessary, but each iteration loop must redefine &quot;what&quot; clearly.</span></p><p><img src="./../Images/image-20231008194116918.png" alt="image-20231008194116918" style="zoom:50%;" /></p><h4 id='define-system-functions'><span>Define system functions</span></h4><p><span>The specification of a system usually starts by the definition of needs.

By purely functional techniques, I mean an analysis that consists in breaking down high-level functions into more detailed functions without zigzagging, i.e., by remaining only in the specification/problem domain. There are two major reasons to argue that such techniques are unsuitable for systems which are not toy systems.</span></p><p><span>The first reason is that a function is not a requirement. Indeed a function is unitless, it does not prescribe any performance value. Consequently, one cannot choose or design an appropriate solution that solves the problem by satisfying the requirements. In the example below, the function </span><em><span>Capter les ordres de la télécommande</span></em><span> can be realized by many designs, such as a Bluetooth receptor </span></p><p><span>The second reason is that to decompose functions (and requirements too), the designer must zigzag. For example, suppose you want to design a vehicle that satisfies the following four system functions: go forward, go backward, stop, and turn. We cannot decompose these system functions into lower level technical functions unless we first conceptualize the design solution that can satisfy these highest-level functions. If we decide to use an electric motor as a design concept to realize the functions of moving forward, the decomposed technical functions at the next systemic level - i.e., the motor level - would be quite different from those that would have resulted had we chosen gas turbines as the design concept. Therefore, when we define the functions in a &quot;solution-neutral&quot; environment, we have to &quot;zig&quot; to the solution/design domain, and after proper design concepts are chosen, we have  to &quot;zag&quot; to the problem/specification domain for further decomposition.</span></p><figure class='table-figure'><table><thead><tr><th style='text-align:center;' ><span>FAST definition</span></th><th style='text-align:center;' ><span>FAST example</span></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='text-align:center;' ><img src="./../Images/image-20231008154658088.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="image-20231008154658088"></td><td style='text-align:center;' ><img src="./../Images/image-20231008154616576.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="image-20231008154616576"></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><span>The design choices made at a given systemic level will influence the functions and requirements at the next systemic level. For instance, consider the following design problem. The pilot of the helicopter system desires to hoist a load. Based on two different operational scenarios, the system function &quot;to hoist a load&quot; is derived into two system requirements. The first operational scenario for mountain rescue operations consists in hoisting a person and a gendarme. Based on this operational scenario a first requirement &quot;To hoist a load between 50 kg and 300 kg&quot; is specified. A second operational scenario for delivery operations consists in hoisting an heavy load for construction work. A second requirement &quot;To hoist a load between 100 kg and 800 kg&quot; is specified.</span></p><p><img src="./../Images/image-20231008102428045.png" alt="image-20231008102428045" style="zoom:50%;" /></p><p><span>The architecture design at the helicopter system level includes several subsystems including a structure (or fuselage) subsystem, a landing gear subsystem, an avionic subsystem, an electric hoisting subsystem, and an electric generation and distribution subsystem.

The most common approach is to interview internal and external stakeholders and ask them what they expect from the system. A similar qualitative approach named focus group consists of bringing together a small group of stakeholders to answer questions in a moderated setting. Marketing survey - online or not - is also an option to elucidate needs, but it does not offer the opportunity to directly engage with customers so as to better understand their problems, desires, wishes, expectations, etc. When developing consumer products, the benchmarking of competing products or formative user studies may be of interest to identify core system functions and expected performances.</span></p><p><img src="./../Images/image-20231005202531585.png" alt="image-20231005202531585" style="zoom:50%;" /></p><ul><li><p><strong><span>System life cycle definition</span></strong></p></li></ul><p><span>Whatever your preferred elicitation techniques, to maximize the level of confidence in the completeness of the set of needs, you can perform a system analysis based on the following assumptions.

During elicitation activities, it is important to ask the stakeholders to prioritize what they are asking for. Some things will be especially important to the stakeholder, while other things may be “nice-to-haves” or “desires”, but not critical to the system being able to achieve the agreed to mission. There will be some things that the stakeholder may be able to “live without” given budget or schedule constraints or conflicting stakeholder needs and stakeholder-owned requirements.</span></p><p><span>Stakeholders need to make clear which things are critical for the system to be able to meet its intended purpose in the operating environment.

It is common for stakeholders to state their needs at a high level of abstraction resulting in ambiguity as to their exact intent as it applies to the SOI.</span></p></li><li><p><span>[Implementation free] Stakeholders often state their needs as implementation statements or solutions rather than address the problem and needs concerning a solution to the problem. The focus should be on the &quot;what&quot; not &quot;how”. When a stakeholder states a specific implementation or solution, ask “</span><em><span>Why?</span></em><span>” and “</span><em><span>What does that implementation or solution allow you to do?</span></em><span>” A common approach is to ask “why” multiple times. The answers to the questions will help uncover the real needs. In addition, avoiding implementation allows the project team to be more innovative in defining an effective design solution.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Stakeholders will often have both explicit AND implicit needs. Stakeholders will often focus on functionality, performance, and user interfaces, assuming everything else will be addressed by the developing project team. The stakeholders assume the project team knows what they are assuming. The stakeholder’s expectations for their implicit needs are often the same as for what they have explicitly stated. If the implicit needs are not met, the system may fail system validation, even though those needs and requirements were not explicitly stated. To avoid this issue, the project team must ask questions concerning areas of interest not explicitly stated by the stakeholders. For example, what quality attributes do they need the SOI to have? What standards or regulations need to be adhered to? What are the drivers and constraints?</span></p></li><li><p><span>Stories, scenarios, use cases, system concepts, ops concepts, concepts of operation, etc. often focus on functionality, performance, and interactions with other systems, but are often incomplete, not addressing other “non-functional” needs such as quality needs (-ilities), e.g. maintenability, availability, security, reliability…, design and construction standards, regulations, and physical characteristics.

In such a legacy and large scale Business to Business (B2B) project, marketing does not play a key role in the definition of stakeholder needs and system requirements.

In this case study, we will assume that to get a complete and correct set of requirements, we must start by identifying all potential sources of requirements, that is, the stakeholders and external systems. To avoid missing any stakeholder or external system, we will systematically define the system contexts for each life cycle phase.</span></p><p><span>Below is a definition of the Helicopter System Life Cycle using a </span><a href='https://docs.nomagic.com/display/MD2022x/State+Machine+diagram'><span>SysML State Machine (stm) diagram</span></a><span>. States, which are graphically represented by boxes, encode life cycle phases.

For instance, in the contexts &quot;To land rolling&quot; or &quot;To land for rolling test&quot;, after touching down, the pilot will desire &quot;To slow down&quot; and &quot;To control the trajectory on ground&quot; (with differential braking). However, the system functions &quot;To slow down&quot; and &quot;To control the trajectory on ground&quot; would not be necessary part of the context &quot;To land on heli-deck, oil rig, on slop, on ground helipad&quot; since, in this life situation, the pilot will not expect to move on ground.</span></p><p><span>The graphical representation of a context diagram is a </span><a href='https://docs.nomagic.com/display/SYSMLP2022x/SysML+Block+Definition+Diagram'><span>SysML Block Definition Diagram (BDD)</span></a><span> where a block encoding the context is composed of the system of interest, stakholders, external systems and environmental conditions.

For instance, knowing that the legacy (or brownfield) Helicopter System has a landing gear subystem, the pilot desires to perform 4 main functions while cruising:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>To lock the wheel of the nose landing gear in axis (to avoid structural damages due to collision with the fuselage while retracting),</span></p></li><li><p><span>To extend the landing gear in nominal mode,</span></p></li><li><p><span>To retract the landing gear, and</span></p></li><li><p><span>To extend the landing gear in emergency mode (i.e., when system is encountering a failure).</span></p></li></ul><p><em><strong><span>Functions must be implementation-free!!!</span></strong><span> We usually pretend that the functions performed by (aka. or services provided by) a system must be solution-agnostic, that is, free of any design and/or implementation choices. So, why the landing gear should be retractable and equipped with wheels? Why don&#39;t we prefer skids ?! More radically, in a greenfield/clean sheet development, we may ignore the landing gear subsystem and ask: what are the &quot;right&quot; services (aka. system functions) the helicopter has to provide (aka. perform) to the test pilot? One technique to identify those solution-free functions is to challenge the design choice by answering the question &quot;Why do we need a landing gear?&quot;. Two main system functions 1/ To minimize fuel consumption (by reducing aerodynamic loads) and 2/ To minimize noise (inside and outside) would motivate the choice for a retractable landing gear, whereas other main function 3/ To move on ground requires wheels rather than skids. When developing such legacy systems, the main objective is not to foster creativity and innovation but to master the system complexity. Therefore, it is not necessary to ignore the existing design but you should always challenge paraphrases of hasty design decisions by asking &quot;Why?&quot; and find the right compromise.</span></em></p><p><img src="./../Images/image-20231008111450030.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="image-20231008111450030"></p><h4 id='define-system-external-interfaces'><span>Define System External Interfaces</span></h4><p><img src="./../Images/image-20231008152052569.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="image-20231008152052569"></p><h4 id='define-system-transformation-functions'><strong><span>Define System Transformation-Functions</span></strong></h4><p><img src="./../Images/image-20231008151909362.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="image-20231008151909362"></p><h4 id='helicopter-system-requirements'><span>Helicopter System Requirements</span></h4><p><span>Functional VS.
