			<p class="latestnews" align="justify" style = "text-align: justify; font: arial; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">[Context] The design activity relies on rules preventing errors. Design errors are choices that make certain designs "not allowed" or inappropriate for their intended use. Design rules arise from all stages of a product life cycle. For instance, when a maintenance operator observes a systematic failure, his observation should lead to a new design rule. Such a design strategy is known as Design for X (DFX or DfX). Nevertheless, the ever-increasing complexity of engineered systems and projects lead to a bewildering array of rules among which a subset is only of interest for a specific designer. The subset of design rules that is of interest for a given designer depends on the design context. For instance, a mechanical designer designing the ribs in aluminum of an aircraft wing using the part design workbench of the CATIA software is interested by the rules that belong to the design context: DC = {domain = mechanics; role = designer; part = rib; material = aluminum; system = aircraft; sub-system = wing; software = CATIA; workbench = Part design}. [Problem] So far, design rules are stored in documents or in the head of subject-matter experts. Design rules are therefore difficult to collect, validate, store, retrieve, use, verify, and maintain. [Proposition] We propose a design rules framework that enables a subject-matter expert to formally encode design rules in a shared and structured knowledge base. Embedded in a Computer Aided Design (CAD) environment, our ontology will extend traditional CAD capabilities as it will, for instance, ease: 1) the retrieval of rules according to a particular design context, and 2) the recommendation of design rules while a design activity is being performed [Future work] Our Design Rules Framework will be improved before integrating it in a CAD environment to provide designers with an extended CAD environment.</p>

			<p class="latestnews" align="justify" style = "text-align: justify; font: arial; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;"><b>Presented at:</b> CIRP Design 2018, Nantes, France, 23-25 May 2018 (Nominated for the Best Paper Award)<br /></p>
			<p class="latestnews" align="justify" style = "text-align: justify; font: arial; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;"><i><b>Authors:</b> Pinqui&eacute, Romain; V&eacuteron, Philippe; Segonds, Fr&eacuted&eacuteric; Crou&eacute, Nicolas</i><br /><br /></p>
			<p class="latestnews" align="justify" style = "text-align: justify; font: arial; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">[Context] The design of engineered socio-technical systems relies on a value chain within which suppliers must cope with larger and larger sets of requirements. Although 70 % of the total life cycle cost is committed during the concept phase and most industrial projects originally fail due to poor requirements engineering, very few methods and tools exist to support suppliers. In this paper, we propose to methodologically integrate data science techniques into a collaborative requirement mining framework to enable suppliers to gain insight and discover opportunities in a massive set of requirements. The proposed workflow is a five-activity process including: (1) the extraction of requirements from documents and (2) the analysis of their quality by using natural language processing techniques; (3) the segmentation of requirements into communities using text mining and graph theory; (4) the collaborative and multidisciplinary estimation of decision making criteria; and (5) the reporting of estimations with an analytical dashboard of statistical indicators. We conclude that the methodological integration of data science techniques is an effective way to gain insight from hundreds or thousands of requirements before making informed decisions early on. The software prototype that supports our workflow is a JAVA web application developed on top of a graph-oriented data model implemented with the NoSQL NEO4J graph database. As a future work, the semi-structured as-required baseline could be a sound input to feed a formal approach, such as model- and simulation-based systems engineering.</p>

			<p class="latestnews" align="justify" style = "text-align: justify; font: arial; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;"> It is broadly accepted that 70 % of the total life cycle cost is committed during the specification phase. However, nowadays, we observe a staggering increase in the number of requirements. We consider the tremendous volume of requirements as big data with which sub-contractors struggle to make strategic decisions early on. Thus, we propose to methodologically integrate data science techniques into a collaborative requirement mining framework, which enables decision-makers to gain insight and discover opportunities in a massive set of requirements. Initially, classification models extract requirements from prescriptive documents. Requirements are subsequently analysed with natural language processing techniques so as to identify quality defects. After having removed the quality defects, the analyst can navigate through clusters of requirements that ease the exploration of big data. Each cluster gathers the requirements that belong to a functional area (mechanics, electronics, IT, etc.). Each domain expert can therefore easily filter out the requirements subset that is relevant for him. A complementary approach consists in detecting communities of requirements by analysing the topology of a graph. Each community owns a customisable set of decision-making criteria which are estimated by all functional areas. A dashboard of statistical visuals distils the estimation results from which a decision maker can make informed decisions. We conclude that the theoretical and empirical validation of our proposition corroborates the assumption that data science is an effective way to gain insight from hundreds or thousands of requirements.</p>

			<p class="latestnews" align="justify" style = "text-align: justify; font: arial; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">PLM software applications should enable engineers to develop and manage requirements throughout the product's life-cycle. However, PLM activities of the beginning-of-life and end-of-life of a product mainly deal with a fastidious document-based approach. Indeed, requirements are scattered in many different prescriptive documents (reports, specifications, standards, regulations, etc.) that make the feeding of a requirements management tool laborious. Our contribution is twofold. First, we propose a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to extract requirements from prescriptive documents. Second, we show how machine learning techniques can be used to develop a text classifier that will automatically classify requirements into disciplines. Both contributions support companies willing to feed a requirements management tool from prescriptive documents. The NLP experiment shows an average precision of 0.86 and an average recall of 0.95, whereas the SVM requirements classifier outperforms that of Naive Bayes with a 76 % accuracy rate.</p>

Firstly, it is intended to demonstrate the relevance of the Property Model Methodology (PMM) to specify, validate, design and verify continuous multi-physics systems. Secondly, it aims at verifying the compatibility of PMM concepts with the Modelica simulation language. We will be using the case study of an aircraft landing gear to show how to translate the theoretical concepts of PMM into executable Modelica models. This article proves the fundamental concepts of PMM and provides a starting point for further research so as to not only model other types of engineered systems such as discrete and hybrid systems, but also support additional systems engineering activities, such as safety-reliability.</p>

			<p class="latestnews" align="justify" style = "text-align: justify; font: arial; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">The enterprise level software application that supports the strategic product-centric, lifecycle-oriented and information-driven Product Lifecycle Management business approach should enable engineers to develop and manage requirements within a Functional Digital Mock-Up. The integrated, model-based product design ENOVIA/CATIA V6 RFLP environment makes it possible to use parametric modelling among requirements, functions, logical units and physical organs. Simulation can therefore be used to verify that the design artefacts comply with the requirements. Nevertheless, when dealing with document-based specifications, the definition of the knowledge parameters for each requirement is a labour-intensive task. Indeed, analysts have no other alternative than to go through the voluminous specifications to identify the values of the performance requirements and design constraints, and to translate them into knowledge parameters. We propose to use natural language processing techniques to automatically generate Parametric Property-Based Requirements from unstructured and semi-structured specifications. We illustrate our approach through the design of a mechanical ring.</p>

			<p class="latestnews" align="justify" style = "text-align: justify; font: arial; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">Product lifecycle management (PLM) is a strategic product-centric, lifecycle-oriented and information-driven business approach that strives to integrate people and their inherent practices, processes, and technologies, both within and across functional areas of the extended enterprise from inception to disposal. The integration of people relies on the harmonisation of domain-specific glossaries by standardising a universal PLM vocabulary. So far, unfortunately, there is no PLM standard vocabulary. Therefore, the tremendous amount of knowledge that is continually brought forward by academic research studies, industrial practices and computer-aided applications causes semantic ambiguities. This paper consists of an illustrated glossary and a conceptual map. The glossary identifies, discusses, clarifies and illustrates ambiguous terms used in discrete manufacturing. The conceptual map finally underlines the logical flow of refereed definitions.</p>
