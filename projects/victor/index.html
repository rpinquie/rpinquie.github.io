		<p><b>[Context]</b> The design of complex engineered systems in a model-centric approach relies on a set of models capturing different views of the system-of-interest. <b>[Problem]</b> Today, practitioners spend inordinate effort transposing models from rigorous tools to non-structured formats to overcome the acceptance problem. In the process, the connection to the source repository is lost, thereby destroying integrity, reusability, maintainability and currency of the derived output when the source changes. Moreover, with the ever increasing number of heterogenous models, the architect has no holistic view and no other alternative than to navigate through a bewildering array of models to get the gist of the architecture and must reconstruct implicit links between the model elements while navigating. <b>[Proposition]</b> We propose an immersive virtual environment that enables end-users to review models by exploring 3D digital threads. <b>[Results]</b> An experimental comparison with a slides-based design review has shown that there is no statistical difference in terms of speed to perform an activity, level of understanding of the models, level of confidence, usability and congnitive load. The 33 participants to the experiment were slower in the virtual environement and had the same level of understanding of the models. They also had a better confidence level in the virtual environment and reported a better level of usability and a lower cognitive load. <b>[Future work]</b> Future work will concentrate on the influence of visual metaphors</p>
