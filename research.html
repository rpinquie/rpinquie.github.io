			<p class="latestnews" align="justify" style = "text-align: justify; font: arial; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">New design objectives such as the digital twin encourage companies to replace the traditional document-base systems engineering approach by a model-centric one. All views on the system rely on different types of models that serve many objectives, especially to improve the communication among stakeholders. However, the ever-increasing number of heterogeneous and scattered models jeopardize the communication at the end. Indeed, to get a holistic view of the virtual definition, engineers have no other alternative than to navigate through numerous models requiring domain specific software and language. In this paper, we propose to use virtual reality to develop an immersive environment for a collaborative model-centric review of engineered systems. The virtual environment, which relies on a digital threads stored in a graph-oriented database, enable users to explore a model-centric design by navigating through the models in a unique virtual space. To illustrate our proposal, we use a model-centric design of a telescope and shows how our preliminary prototype of the virtual environment supports the reviewing activity with data limited to the architecture and geometry. Future works, will concentrate on the integration of data related to other perspectives on the system and the prototyping of the collaborative capabilities.</p>

			<p class="latestnews" align="justify" style = "text-align: justify; font: arial; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">Open-source hardware (OSH) development is a new design paradigm from a commercial perspective. Openly sharing designs of technical products is a step towards democratising access to new technologies for the benefit of individuals and communities in society. At the core of the open-source hardware definition lies the freedom for anyone to replicate the hardware based on the design. Thus, enabling this freedom is a step towards developing a successful OSH. Previous research supposes that a bill of materials and assembly instructions are enough for this. In this study, we question this assumption and investigate what other factors may influence replicability of an OSH. Using data from a survey and interviews with OSH practitioners, we identify and describe these factors, which relate to the documentation, the design and the context of the person replicating the hardware. Using these insights, we present a diagram of the replication process along with questions the person replicating the hardware would ask to check whether an OSH is replicable. Finally, we synthesise this information into practical advice for OSH projects to increase the replicability of the designs they produce, and thus the likelihood of their project's success.</p>

			<p class="latestnews" align="justify" style = "text-align: justify; font: arial; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">Making a hardware open-source consists of making accessible the documentation of the system so that everyone can use this design for its own purpose. It is an increasing phenomenon that goes hand in hand with the developments of the makers movements and the underpinning societal changes that are at stake today. However, poorly structured communities are sometimes struggling with problems inherent to the reuse of exiting designs. Besides, the exponential number of web-sites and platforms hosting open-source projects makes it almost impossible to properly find similar products or designs to get inspiration from. Design reuse has been an important practice in industry since decades. This paper looks for exiting design reuse research work and makes an attempt to elicit the main characteristics of design reuse identified in the literature. From this, we discuss the conditions of the application of design reuse for open-source hardware products. We conclude that a goal-oriented approach based on the basic principles of open-source hardware (right to study, modify, make, distribute) can be used to structure the approach towards a documentation that allows capture of design rational, documented product models and guidelines for documentation practices.</p>

			<p class="latestnews" align="justify" style = "text-align: justify; font: arial; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">Although companies systematically strive for a full digitalisation of their products and their processes, the design phase shows that the quality of models is very unequal. Indeed, detailed design benefit from much more sophisticated methods and tools than the specification and architecture activities. However, we should note the recent paradigm shift from document-based to model-based system engineering. However, these models, which are mainly static 2D diagrams, remain too poor to facilitate the early detection of design errors. Thus, to detect most errors that occur during the design phase, companies have no other alternative than to wait up to the testing phase which occurs after several years for complex systems. Thus, we propose a holistic user-centred computer-aided verification process to ensure that the design meets the requirements under realistic operational conditions. The verification process provides a progressive immersion into the virtual system before seamlessly transitioning from the virtual to the real system. Our work relies on state-of-the-art MBSE methods such as the Property Model Methodology, which enables systems engineers to co-simulate specification models and design models. We improve such MBSE methods by increasing the level of realism that experiences the end-user during the verification of a design by the original combination of Model-In-the-Loop, Immersive Model-In-the-Loop, Human-In-the-Loop, and Hardware-In-the-Loop simulation strategies.</p>

			<p class="latestnews" align="justify" style = "text-align: justify; font: arial; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">[Context] Virtual reality (VR) is getting more and more interest for supporting engineering activities in industry 4.0, especially for reviewing candidate design solutions. Nevertheless, the modelling of the geometry is still based on traditional CAD software before being transformed into polyhedral objects for VR. However, in the future, we may expect engineers to parsimoniously sculpt 3D shapes in VR. Indeed, immersive modelling has three main advantages: 1) designers directly interact with the 3D modelling environment in near-real time, 2) designers can manipulate a full-scale model in the VR environment, and 3) VR provides an intuitive environment which can be used for early product development [1]. In this paper, we address the question: What are the current state-of-the art CAD capabilities and limits in virtual reality? To answer the question, we have conducted a systematic literature review of existing proposals that aim at modelling 3D shapes in virtual reality. Then, we compare them in a benchmark that helps us to draw conclusions on the current limits and future research perspectives.</p>

			<p class="latestnews" align="justify" style = "text-align: justify; font: arial; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">The design of complex engineered systems highly relies on a laborious zigzagging between computer-aided design (CAD) software and design rules prescribed by design manuals. Despite the emergence ofknowledge management techniques (ontology, expert system, text mining, etc.), companies continue tostore design rules in large and unstructured documents. To facilitate the integration of design rules andCAD software, we propose a knowledge graph that structures a large set of design rules in a computableformat. The knowledge graph organises entities of design rules (nodes), relationships among design rules(edges), as well as contextual information. The categorisation of entities and relationships in four sub-contexts: semantic, social, engineering, and IT - facilitates the development of the data model, especiallythe definition of the "design context" concept. The knowledge graph paves the way to a context-awarecognitive design assistant. Indeed, connected to or embedded in a CAD software, a context-aware cog-nitive design assistant will capture the design context in near real time and run reasoning operationson the knowledge graph to extend traditional CAD capabilities, such as the recommendation of designrules, the verification of design solutions, or the automation of design routines. Our validation experi-ment shows that the current version of the context-aware cognitive design assistant is more efficientthan the traditional document-based design. On average, participants using an unstructured design rulesdocument have a precision of 0.36 whereas participants using our demonstrator obtain a 0.61 precisionscore. Finally, designers supported by the design assistant spend more time designing than searching forapplicable design rules compared to the traditional design approach.</p>

Nowadays, design rules try to consider all product lifecycle's phases leading to an ever-increasing growth. This context makes the management of design rules a difficult but essential task. This is why many research and industrial works try to automate this task [1, 3, 4]. [Problem] The processing of design rules, which are natural language sentences stored in unstructured documents, requires expert software. Moreover, existing tools interrupt the design workflow and slow down the design process. [Proposition] We propose a Context-Aware Cognitive Design Assistant (CACDA) to support designers who have to satisfy some design rules among "Big Data". First, we describe the CACDA from the user's perspective. Second, we detail the process for modelling unstructured design rules into a com-putable knowledge graph that will feed the cognitive design assistant. [Future Work] Once our knowledge graph of design rules will be operational, we will concentrate on its processing to retrieve, recommend, and verify design rules. Experiments will also help to determine pros and cons of the design assistant.</p>

In this paper, we try to better understand how the reuse of design solutions facilitates company-community collaboration. On the one hand, based on existing research studies, we analyze three fundamental questions - 1) who wants to reuse a design? 2) Why do they want to reuse a design?, and 3) How do they reuse a design? - from a company perspective and a community perspective. On the other hand, we identified that companies and communities must create a common understanding of the design problems and solution and they could benefit in reusing design artifact to speed up the development time and improve the quality and transferability of the results. However, this research shows that companies and communities don't use the same type of tools and methods to reuse design knowledge which may cause some problems for collaboration.</p>

[Problem] Although there are numerous technological alternatives for managing knowledge, design departments continue to store design rules in nearly unusable documents. Indeed, existing propositions based on basic information retrieval techniques applied to unstructured engineering documents do not provide good results. Conversely, the development and management of structured ontologies are too laborious. [Proposition] We propose a property graph data model that paves the way to a context-aware design assistant.

			<p class="latestnews" align="justify" style = "text-align: justify; font: arial; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">[Context] The design activity relies on rules preventing errors. Design errors are choices that make certain designs "not allowed" or inappropriate for their intended use. Design rules arise from all stages of a product life cycle. For instance, when a maintenance operator observes a systematic failure, his observation should lead to a new design rule. Such a design strategy is known as Design for X (DFX or DfX). Nevertheless, the ever-increasing complexity of engineered systems and projects lead to a bewildering array of rules among which a subset is only of interest for a specific designer. The subset of design rules that is of interest for a given designer depends on the design context. For instance, a mechanical designer designing the ribs in aluminum of an aircraft wing using the part design workbench of the CATIA software is interested by the rules that belong to the design context: DC = {domain = mechanics; role = designer; part = rib; material = aluminum; system = aircraft; sub-system = wing; software = CATIA; workbench = Part design}. [Problem] So far, design rules are stored in documents or in the head of subject-matter experts. Design rules are therefore difficult to collect, validate, store, retrieve, use, verify, and maintain. [Proposition] We propose a design rules framework that enables a subject-matter expert to formally encode design rules in a shared and structured knowledge base. Embedded in a Computer Aided Design (CAD) environment, our ontology will extend traditional CAD capabilities as it will, for instance, ease: 1) the retrieval of rules according to a particular design context, and 2) the recommendation of design rules while a design activity is being performed [Future work] Our Design Rules Framework will be improved before integrating it in a CAD environment to provide designers with an extended CAD environment.</p>

			<p class="latestnews" align="justify" style = "text-align: justify; font: arial; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">[Context] The design of engineered socio-technical systems relies on a value chain within which suppliers must cope with larger and larger sets of requirements. Although 70 % of the total life cycle cost is committed during the concept phase and most industrial projects originally fail due to poor requirements engineering, very few methods and tools exist to support suppliers. In this paper, we propose to methodologically integrate data science techniques into a collaborative requirement mining framework to enable suppliers to gain insight and discover opportunities in a massive set of requirements. The proposed workflow is a five-activity process including: (1) the extraction of requirements from documents and (2) the analysis of their quality by using natural language processing techniques; (3) the segmentation of requirements into communities using text mining and graph theory; (4) the collaborative and multidisciplinary estimation of decision making criteria; and (5) the reporting of estimations with an analytical dashboard of statistical indicators. We conclude that the methodological integration of data science techniques is an effective way to gain insight from hundreds or thousands of requirements before making informed decisions early on. The software prototype that supports our workflow is a JAVA web application developed on top of a graph-oriented data model implemented with the NoSQL NEO4J graph database. As a future work, the semi-structured as-required baseline could be a sound input to feed a formal approach, such as model- and simulation-based systems engineering.</p>

			<p class="latestnews" align="justify" style = "text-align: justify; font: arial; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;"> It is broadly accepted that 70 % of the total life cycle cost is committed during the specification phase. However, nowadays, we observe a staggering increase in the number of requirements. We consider the tremendous volume of requirements as big data with which sub-contractors struggle to make strategic decisions early on. Thus, we propose to methodologically integrate data science techniques into a collaborative requirement mining framework, which enables decision-makers to gain insight and discover opportunities in a massive set of requirements. Initially, classification models extract requirements from prescriptive documents. Requirements are subsequently analysed with natural language processing techniques so as to identify quality defects. After having removed the quality defects, the analyst can navigate through clusters of requirements that ease the exploration of big data. Each cluster gathers the requirements that belong to a functional area (mechanics, electronics, IT, etc.). Each domain expert can therefore easily filter out the requirements subset that is relevant for him. A complementary approach consists in detecting communities of requirements by analysing the topology of a graph. Each community owns a customisable set of decision-making criteria which are estimated by all functional areas. A dashboard of statistical visuals distils the estimation results from which a decision maker can make informed decisions. We conclude that the theoretical and empirical validation of our proposition corroborates the assumption that data science is an effective way to gain insight from hundreds or thousands of requirements.</p>

			<p class="latestnews" align="justify" style = "text-align: justify; font: arial; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">PLM software applications should enable engineers to develop and manage requirements throughout the product's life-cycle. However, PLM activities of the beginning-of-life and end-of-life of a product mainly deal with a fastidious document-based approach. Indeed, requirements are scattered in many different prescriptive documents (reports, specifications, standards, regulations, etc.) that make the feeding of a requirements management tool laborious. Our contribution is twofold. First, we propose a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to extract requirements from prescriptive documents. Second, we show how machine learning techniques can be used to develop a text classifier that will automatically classify requirements into disciplines. Both contributions support companies willing to feed a requirements management tool from prescriptive documents. The NLP experiment shows an average precision of 0.86 and an average recall of 0.95, whereas the SVM requirements classifier outperforms that of Naive Bayes with a 76 % accuracy rate.</p>

			<p class="latestnews" align="justify" style = "text-align: justify; font: arial; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">The aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, it is intended to demonstrate the relevance of the Property Model Methodology (PMM) to specify, validate, design and verify continuous multi-physics systems. Secondly, it aims at verifying the compatibility of PMM concepts with the Modelica simulation language. We will be using the case study of an aircraft landing gear to show how to translate the theoretical concepts of PMM into executable Modelica models. This article proves the fundamental concepts of PMM and provides a starting point for further research so as to not only model other types of engineered systems such as discrete and hybrid systems, but also support additional systems engineering activities, such as safety-reliability.</p>

			<p class="latestnews" align="justify" style = "text-align: justify; font: arial; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">The enterprise level software application that supports the strategic product-centric, lifecycle-oriented and information-driven Product Lifecycle Management business approach should enable engineers to develop and manage requirements within a Functional Digital Mock-Up. The integrated, model-based product design ENOVIA/CATIA V6 RFLP environment makes it possible to use parametric modelling among requirements, functions, logical units and physical organs. Simulation can therefore be used to verify that the design artefacts comply with the requirements. Nevertheless, when dealing with document-based specifications, the definition of the knowledge parameters for each requirement is a labour-intensive task. Indeed, analysts have no other alternative than to go through the voluminous specifications to identify the values of the performance requirements and design constraints, and to translate them into knowledge parameters. We propose to use natural language processing techniques to automatically generate Parametric Property-Based Requirements from unstructured and semi-structured specifications. We illustrate our approach through the design of a mechanical ring.</p>

			<p class="latestnews" align="justify" style = "text-align: justify; font: arial; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">With the fastidiously ever-increasing complexity of systems, the relentless, massive customisation of products and the mushrooming accumulation of legal documents (standards, policies and laws), we can observe a significant increase in requirements. We consider the tremendous volume of requirements as big data with which companies struggle to make strategic decisions early on. This paper proposes a collaborative requirement mining framework to enable the decision-makers of an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) to gain insight and discover opportunities in a massive set of requirements so as to make early effective strategic decisions. The framework supports OEMs willing to uncover a subset of key requirements by distilling large unstructured and semi-structured specifications.</p>

			<p class="latestnews" align="justify" style = "text-align: justify; font: arial; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">Product lifecycle management (PLM) is a strategic product-centric, lifecycle-oriented and information-driven business approach that strives to integrate people and their inherent practices, processes, and technologies, both within and across functional areas of the extended enterprise from inception to disposal. The integration of people relies on the harmonisation of domain-specific glossaries by standardising a universal PLM vocabulary. So far, unfortunately, there is no PLM standard vocabulary. Therefore, the tremendous amount of knowledge that is continually brought forward by academic research studies, industrial practices and computer-aided applications causes semantic ambiguities. This paper consists of an illustrated glossary and a conceptual map. The glossary identifies, discusses, clarifies and illustrates ambiguous terms used in discrete manufacturing. The conceptual map finally underlines the logical flow of refereed definitions.</p>
